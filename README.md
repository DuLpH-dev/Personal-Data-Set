Data Analytics Personal Data Set

Motivation-
I am from Germany, and am an avid lifelong soccer fan. My motivation for this project was to do some form of statistical analysis of soccer stats in Germany. I ultimately settled on goalkeeping stats from the last year in the Bundesliga. I chose this data because there are a limited number of goalies in the league, and there are a few key stats that are very important for goalies. Therefore, I thought that this dataset would have a manageable scope. I went in specifically wanting to find out who the most successful goalkeepers are, and whether I can identify any specific trends in what makes a goalkeeper successful. 

Data Source and Cleaning - 
The data was drawn from a website called fbref. This site compiles a lot of sports statistics.https://fbref.com/en/comps/20/keepersadv/Bundesliga-Stats#all_stats_keeper_adv The dataset is a compilation of basic stats for the season, along with some analytical stats from a site called StatsBomb. These analytical stats are things such as expected goals against. My data cleaning process was relatively simple. I downloaded the data as a .xlsx, and then pulled it into Excel to do some basic cleaning. There were a few data points that were blank, which I filled. a Major issue was that a lot of these European players have special characters in their names, which neither r nor Excel really know how to handle. I deleted these and replaced them with their closes alphanumeric equivalent. After this, I pulled the data into r, and ran a script to remove any row for a goalkeeper that had played less than 4 full games this season. I did this because most of the analysis I wanted to do had to do with averages across the season, and goalkeepers who had played only a few games were very prone to outliers. Additionally, any numeric data I wanted to work with had to be changed into a numeric. I used as.numeric() to do this. 

Visualization-
Out of basic interest, I wanted to see how accurate the predictive statistics from statsbomb were. To do this, I made a simple scatterplot comparing goalies' expected goals conceded against the real number, and added a line of best fit. The predictive stats were consistently close, but there is certainly deviation.

The actually important visualization I chose to undertake took some additional working on the data. I wanted to see which goalies were performing well on an individual level. Just seeing who conceded the most goals overall was weak, because not everyone had the same playtime. I therefore created a new column in the data-frame that divided the number of goals conceded by a goalie by the number of games played to find the average goals conceded per game. I would have preferred seeing how many shots goalies were stopping on average, rather than goals conceded by time, but I did not have access to these numbers. After this I made a box plot of these, to look for potential outliers of goalies who concede a lot for how much they play, and to see where to average generally lies.

I struggled to find a way to label the outliers on the chart, but did not succeed. The three outliers are Ralf Faehrmann, and Frederik Raennow. Interestingly, both of them play for the same club this season, Schalke 04. The club has been spectacularly unsuccessful, so it makes sense to see both of them conceding a lot. 

Analysis-
Now that I had a measure of how much goalies were conceding per game, rather than just how much they conceded in total, I wanted to plot this against a few other factors to see whether these seemed to be correlated. I plotted concession rate against keepers' ages, against keepers' playtime (to see if goalies who play more consistently perform better), and against sweeper involvements (This indicates an aggressive playstyle in which a goalie plays far forward outside of his goal and acts almost as a defender, blocking the ball and cutting off runs into their box). These plots are shown below.

Playtime and concession rate do seem correlated. In the chart the goalkeepers how had less playtime were more spread, and some had very high concession rate. That being said, the smaller sample sizes could also be making these concession rates larger outliers, which would explain why the right side of the graph is so much more tightly clustered. 

Age and concession rate are relatively split. The most successful keepers in this category are relatively middle aged by goalkeeper standards, while the oldest and youngest goalkeepers are generally closer to the line of best fit. This would make sense, as younger goalies tend to be more mistake prone, while older goalies tend to be physically more limited by their bodies. 

Sweeper involvement does seem to be a positive thing. The goalkeepers on the right side of this graph, the ones who tend to become strongly involved as sweepers, tend to perform very positively. Generally, aside from Oliver Baumann, the four goalies on the farthest right of this graph are generally considered to be the best in the leagye. This is particularly true of Manuel Neuer, who is consistently in the conversation for best Goalkeeper in the world. At the same time, goalies such as Marwin Hitz demonstrate that a conservative playstyle is also viable.
