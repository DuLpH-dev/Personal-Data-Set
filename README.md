The above chart is a scatter plot demonstrating the relationship between a goalkeepers' expected goals against statistic, compared to the actual goals they conceded that season. This demonstrates that while the expected goals score is correlated to the actual goals scored, it is not a perfect predictor of how many goals a keeper actually conceded. An expansion of this would be examining how accurate this score is as a function of how many minutes the keeper played.
